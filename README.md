# CS-330 - Create a 3D Scene

# How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I prioritize understanding the project requirements and breaking them into smaller, manageable components. My approach emphasizes modularity and planning, ensuring that each part of the software is independently functional and organized. For this project, I created separate functions for each 3D object, which allowed me to make targeted adjustments without affecting the rest of the scene. This approach provided clarity during implementation and facilitated scalability for potential future improvements. Additionally, I learned to incorporate textures and lighting effectively, which enhanced the visual appeal of the scene while maintaining an efficient design process.

# How do I approach developing programs?
Developing programs involves writing clean, reusable code and maintaining proper documentation to ensure functionality and organization. In this project, I implemented new strategies, such as UV mapping for accurate texturing and advanced lighting techniques, which contributed to the realism of the 3D scene. Iteration played a significant role in my process; I began with simple models and gradually refined them through repeated evaluation and enhancement. This iterative approach allowed for constant improvements and ensured that the final product was cohesive and polished. Throughout the milestones, my approach evolved as I tackled challenges, balancing performance optimization with final visuals, and honing my ability to create well-structured, modular code.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
The skills I’ve learned through this project hold significant potential for a range of future applications, depending on the direction my career takes. For instance, I’ve expressed an interest in neuroscience, and during one of the class discussions, I researched how 3D modeling is used within that field. The ability to create detailed neuron models for research is fascinating, and this class has given me valuable insight into how that might be accomplished. Whether I pursue work in computational biology or other fields like virtual reality or game design, these skills provide a strong foundation for visualizing and solving complex problems. The ability to bridge the technical and creative aspects of 3D modeling opens many doors for future educational and professional opportunities.
